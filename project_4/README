Name: Carter Fowler

Collaborators: Ryan Fite

Challenges: I ran into an issue with my map model not producing the same result
as the brute force model, as well as a floating point exception with certain parameters.
I fixed this with the debugger and Ryan's help.

The only thing I didn't like about the assignment was how difficult it was to try and
understand it, but that was likely due to the limited time I afforded myself to complete
this project.

Time: 3.5 hours
