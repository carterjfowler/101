The biggest challenges I faced were picking the largest vector because I forgot a single line of code, and
figuring out when I neeeded to clear data members from previous games, and figuring out what conditions I
needed to check to determine if the given guess was actually correct. I also I had an issue with getline
skipping the first input, but I was able to fix it by using cin.ignore(1, '\n') after looking online.

I liked how challenging this project was, there wasn't really anything I didn't like about this assignment.

I spent about 7 hours on this assignment.
