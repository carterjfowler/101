Challenges: The biggest challenges I faced was converting from string to double and back,
but I easily fixed that when I saw another ask the same question on piazza. Most of my other
issues where due to miss typing something.

I liked everything about this project, it was fun, especially implementing my own functions. I didn't dislike anything.

I spent about 4 hours in total on this assignment.

Added Features:
 (unless otherwise specified, below functions only require one input)
  - csc: cosecant trig function, input must be in radians
  - sec: secant trig function, input must be in radians
  - cot: cotangent trig function, input must be in radians
  - d[sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot]: any of those with a "d" infront of them use input in degrees
  - a[sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot]: any of those with an "a" infront of them are the inverse trig funtion of them
  - to_deg: converts radians to degrees
  - base-e: e to the power of an inputted number
  - cbrt: cube root
  - hyp: calculate the hypotenuse given two side lengths (requires two inputs)
