Partner: Ryan Fite

Challenges: the only big challenged I faced was I kept getting a segmentation fault in my read_preorder function,
and Ryan helped me figure it out. I had forgotten to set my nodes to a "new node".

I really liked this assignment, it really helped me better understand binary trees (specifically how to search them),
there wasn't really anything I disliked about this assignment.

I spent about 2 hours on this project.

Novel Features Added: a delete function using a post-order traversal (if that counts, I'm not sure that it does).
